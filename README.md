# Predicting Employee Attrition

## Problem Statement
Employee attrition can significantly impact organizational performance and productivity. Predicting when and why employees are likely to leave can help organizations proactively address retention challenges. This README outlines the process and insights gained from building a model to predict employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered all necessary data from the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset.
   
2. **Data Preparation**: Cleaned, organized, and standardized data for accuracy.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Dropped unnecessary features from the dataset.
   - Compared attrition with categorical and continuous variables, revealing insightful patterns.
   
4. **Insight Generation**: Extracted actionable insights from the analysis:
   - Higher attrition rate among males compared to females.
   - Highest attrition observed among employees aged 28-32.
   - Spikes in attrition at lower income levels, decreasing as income rises.
   - Employees starting their careers with the company tend to leave more than those with longer tenures.
   
5. **Decision Making**: Utilized data-driven strategies to enhance workforce performance and meet organizational goals based on insights generated.

## Summary of Insights

- **Gender Disparity**: Higher attrition rate among males compared to females.
- **Age Dynamics**: Highest attrition observed between ages 28-32, declining with age.
- **Income Levels**: Spikes in attrition at very low income, decreasing as income rises.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Lower satisfaction correlates with higher attrition, especially for average salaries.
- **Departmental Differences**: Sales and HR departments have the highest attrition rates, while R&D shows lower attrition.
- **Job Role Impact**: Higher-level roles have lower attrition rates.
- **Salary Increment Influence**: Enhanced increments incentivize retention.
- **Educational Background**: Lower attrition observed among higher education levels.
- **Salary and Stock Options**: Higher pay and stock options promote loyalty.
- **Work-Life Balance**: Crucial factor affecting motivation and retention.
